<br>
A student project dedicated to replicate osu! in Unity.
<br>
For now, this game will only work in 16:9 and using any other aspect ratios is very likely to break the game.
<br>
# How To Play
1. Download the binaries in [Release](https://github.com/palapapa/Oss/releases)
1. Extract and run Oss.exe.
2. Click the Oss logo and click "Options".
3. Click "Select Beatmap Location" and choose an osu! song folder(**Do not load too many songs at once as the game currently stores all beatmap data in RAM. Choosing an entire osu! Song folder will freeze your computer!**)
4. Click "Scan Beatmaps". The game should lag as it loads in the beatmaps(I haven't implemented a loading screen).
5. After the game stops lagging, click "Play" and double click on a song to see it playing. There is currently no gameplay feature.
